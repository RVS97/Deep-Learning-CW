        "# Baseline Code\n",
        "\n",
        "This code introduces a two-step training for the N-HPatches problem. In N-HPatches problem, we aim to generate a patch descriptor that is able to perform successfully tasks such as matching, retrieval or verification. \n",
        "\n",
        "Contrary to classical HPatches dataset, in N-HPatches, images contain random non-smooth perturbations produced by a synthetic noise. This noise could be critical when training the descriptor, therefore, we introduce a denoising model that could help us to deal with those perturbations. Denoising models have been already introduced in the course [tutorials](https://github.com/MatchLab-Imperial/deep-learning-course) and lectures, their objective is to generate a clean/denoised version of the input image.  We will refer in this code to the images with noise as `noisy`, to the images after applying the denoise model as `denoised` and the original patches from HPatches (so no extra noise added) which are used as ground-truth for the denoising step as `clean`. \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Thus, we aim to minimize the noise in images before the second step, which is computing a feature vector, also called descriptor. Those descriptions must be a powerful representation of the input patches. The idea behind is that if two descriptors belong two similar patches, they should be close to each other, i.e. have a low Euclidean distance. See figure below:\n",
        "\n",
        "![](https://i.ibb.co/4tvm3Vh/descriptorspace.png)\n",
        "\n",
        "This baseline code gives a method you can use to compare to whatever another approach you develop.  There are several other approaches you can test to see if there is any improvement, e.g. train the descriptor directly with noisy patches, without the denoising model. However, this code provides some guidance about how to implement the different blocks, how to stack them if desired, how to read the data and how to evaluate the method.\n",
        "\n",
        "The values given can be improved without changing the core method, only by tuning correctly the hyperparameters or giving it more training time, among others.\n",
        "\n",
        "As a first step of the project, you should get familiar with the problem and the provided code, so you can develop more complex and robust algorithms afterward. "

Also, usually, we have available 11.4 GB of GPU memory, which is more than enough to run this code. However, some users reported having only 500 MB of GPU memory.

We hoped that by doing so, we will improve the performance of the second part, which is training a network that outputs the descriptor. As we mentioned, a descriptor is a numerical vector that represents the small images we have. The dataset consists of a large number of small images, which are cropped patches from other larger images. Hence, they represent some local part of a scene. That is why there are no objects represented, only corners or textures. Each of these patches is related to a subset of other patches of the dataset by some kind of geometric transformation (e.g. rotation).  For a given patch, we want the network to output a vector that is close to the vectors of the patches that represent the same local part of a scene, while being far from patches do not represent that local part of a scene.\n",

The idea is to train the network so the descriptors from the anchor and positive patch have a low distance between them, and the negative and anchor patch have a large distance between them. \n",

The metric used is called mean Average Precision, which it uses the Precision of the model. The Precision is defined, for a given number of retrieved elements, as the ratio of correct retrieved elements / number of retrieved elements. [Link to Wikipedia with Precision explanation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall).
